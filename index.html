A world become one of salads and sun <br>
Only a fool would say that <br>
A boy with a plan, a natural man <br>
Wearing a white Stetson hat <br> <br>
    
Unhand that gun begone <br>
There's no one to fire upon <br>
If he's holding it high <br>
He's telling a lie <br>
I heard it was you <br>
Talking 'bout a world where all is free <br>
It just couldn't be <br>
And only a fool would say that <br>
The man in the street dragging his feet <br>
Don't wanna hear the bad news <br>
Imagine your face there is his place <br>
Standing inside his brown shoes <br>
You do his nine to five <br>
Drag yourself home half alive <br>
And there on the screen <br>
A man with a dream <br>
I heard it was you <br>
Talking 'bout a world where all is free <br>
It just couldn't be <br>
And only a fool would say that <br>
Anybody on the street <br>
Has murder in his eyes <br>
You feel no pain <br>
And you're younger than you realize <br>
Only a fool would say that <br>
Only a fool <br>
I heard it was you <br>
Talking 'bout a world where all is free <br>
It just couldn't be <br>
And only a fool would say that <br>
Only a fool would say that <br>
Only a fool would say that  <br>
